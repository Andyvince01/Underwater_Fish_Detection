# UnderwaterFishDetection
With increasing interest in studying marine fauna behavior and conservation, this thesis focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for the detection, classification, and tracking of fish in underwater images. The goal is to provide insights into marine species' responses to environmental noise and support ecosystem preservation efforts.
